1. Lists and tuples are arguably Pythonâ€™s most versatile, useful data types. You will find them in virtually every nontrivial Python program.
E.g:thistuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
    thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]#
2. A namespace is a collection of currently defined symbolic names along with information about the object that each name references.
3. * Global variables are declared outside the functions whereas local variables are declared within the functions.
   * Local variables are created when the function starts its execution and are lost when the function ends. Global variables, on the other hand, are created as execution of the program begins and are lost when the program is ended.
4. An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. It typically includes a code editor, a compiler or interpreter, build automation tools, and debugging tools, all integrated into a single graphical user interface (GUI). 
e.g: Visual Studio Code (VS Code),PyCharm
5. a module is a file containing Python definitions and statements.Modules allow you to logically organize your Python code into reusable units. They enable code reuse, simplify maintenance, and support the concept of modular programming.
e.g: # math_module.py
import math

print(math.sqrt(25))  # Output: 5.0
print(math.pi)        # Output: 3.141592653589793
6.  while both arrays and lists can be used for storing collections of items, their differences in terms of data types, memory allocation, functionality, and usage make them suitable for different scenarios and applications.
7. perators are special symbols or keywords used to perform operations on operands. Operands can be variables, constants, or expressions. Operators define how the operands are manipulated to produce a result.
e.g: 
* Addition (+): Adds two operands.
* Subtraction (-): Subtracts the second operand from the first.
* Multiplication (*): Multiplies two operands.
* Division (/): Divides the first operand by the second.
* Modulus (%): Returns the remainder of the division.
* Exponentiation (**): Raises the first operand to the power of the second.
